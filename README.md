### Javascript-Club

* blocks

    This is an attempt to translate my old "Blocks" evolutionary simulation,
    which was originally written in Java, into Javascript.

* mapping

    Code for mapping meetup groups. This is the JS portion, which uses the
    "leaflet" library (and especially the leaflet "clustering" plugin).
