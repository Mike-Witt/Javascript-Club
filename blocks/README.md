# Javascript-Club

Right now there are just some preliminary tests here. Please ignore.

## Notes

* OneBlockAnimation basically works.

* It's running on my AWS instance (Aug 1st).

## Plan

* Perhaps add diagonal moves?

* Create things like the animation area with js, to avoid the hard-coding
  of limits, etc.

* Start looking at the structure for multiple block, and a better "division
  of labor" in the design.

## Issues

* When there's a lot of output happening events appear to get queued up.
    For example when quite a few output statments are turned on, then
    it takes a while for "random move" to start actually moving.
